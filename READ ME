# SortedLinkedList Program

## Overview

The **SortedLinkedList** program is a Java application that reads a list of integers from user input, stores them in a `LinkedList`, sorts the integers in ascending order, and displays the sorted list. The program utilizes Java's **Collections Framework** for sorting and LinkedList operations.

This project was originally designed to demonstrate the use of a `LinkedList` to store and manipulate integer values while following Java code reuse principles and leveraging the functionality provided by Java's standard libraries.

## Features

- Accepts integer input from the command line.
- Stores input in a `LinkedList` data structure.
- Sorts the `LinkedList` in ascending order using the `Collections.sort()` method.
- Outputs the sorted list of integers.
- Handles non-integer inputs gracefully by prompting the user to try again.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed (version 8 or higher).
- This program can be run via the command line or a terminal.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SortedLinkedList.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd SortedLinkedList
   ```

3. **Compile the Java file:**
   ```bash
   javac SortedLinkedList.java
   ```

4. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java SortedLinkedList
   ```

5. **Enter integers:**
   - Type integers followed by the Enter key.
   - When done, type `exit` to finish input.

6. **Example:**
   ```
   Enter integers (type 'exit' to finish):
   7
   2
   15
   exit
   Sorted list: [2, 7, 15]
   ```

## Code Documentation

You can generate the Javadoc for this project using the following command:

```bash
javadoc -d doc SortedLinkedList.java
```

This will create a `doc` folder containing the HTML documentation for the project.
